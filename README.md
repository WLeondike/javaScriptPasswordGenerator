# Java Script Password Generator
This is our first homework dealing with JavaScript. 
We will be creating a password generator of up to 128 characters, no less than 8. 
The password generator will contain upper and lower case characters, special characters, and numbers.
We will ask if you want each of the characters given above within our password.
