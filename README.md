# Java Script Password Generator
This is our first homework dealing with JavaScript. We will be creating a password generator of up to 128 characters, no less than 8. The password generator will contain upper and lower case characters, special characters, and numbers.<br>

If the user inputs a number below 8 or above 128, a message will be recieved to insert a number between 8 and 128.<br> 

When the user inputs an accepted value they will then be directed through four confirm statements. 
<ul>
<li>Would you like uppercase characters?</li>
<li>Would you like lowercase characters?</li>
<li>Would you like special characters?</li>
<li>Would you like numbers?</li>
</ul>
Once they chose at least one confirm statement, their password will be generated determined on how many characters they chose as well as the type of password they would like. <br>
